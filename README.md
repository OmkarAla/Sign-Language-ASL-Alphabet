The repository is designed to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset available at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet). 

**Repository Contents:**

- **`README.md`**: Provides a brief overview of the project's objective, which is to recognize ASL alphabets using the specified dataset.

- **`training.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that likely contains the code for training the machine learning model on the ASL dataset. This would include data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training process, and evaluation metrics.
  
- **`final.py`**: A Python script that possibly includes the final implementation of the ASL recognition model, potentially for deployment or inference purposes.

- **`model_4.p`**: This file appears to be a serialized model object, possibly saved using Python's pickle module, representing the trained model ready for inference.

- **`trail.ipynb`**: Another Jupyter Notebook that might contain exploratory data analysis, model experimentation, or trial runs conducted during the development phase.

- **`ML model demo.mp4`**: A demonstration video showcasing the performance or usage of the trained ASL recognition model.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Acquisition**: The project uses the ASL alphabet dataset from Kaggle, which contains images of hand gestures representing each letter.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps likely include resizing images, normalization, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Development**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is probably implemented to learn and classify the ASL hand gestures.

4. **Training**: The model is trained on the preprocessed images, with hyperparameters tuned for optimal performance.

5. **Evaluation**: The model's accuracy and loss are evaluated on the test set to assess its performance.

6. **Deployment**: The trained model is saved (as seen in `model_4.p`) and can be used for real-time ASL alphabet recognition.

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in facilitating communication for individuals using American Sign Language.
